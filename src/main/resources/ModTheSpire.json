  "description": "Adds Braixen as a playable character (automatically unlocks Ascension up to 15).\nAdds one custom event to all eventpools, limited to the vixen unless you change it in the config.\nAlso adds one custom act 3 boss that is disabled by default. (see config for more details)\nThe main mechanics are temporary damagebuffs, debuff manipulation and self-inflicted damage on enemies.",
